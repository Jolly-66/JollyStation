changes:
  - rscadd: Added a new fishing line reel that speeds up the first half of the fishing
      minigame, and also let's you catch things from afar like a discount meat hook.
  - balance: During the biting phase preceeding the actual minigame, initiating it
      as soon as the "!!!" alert pops up will net you an advantage. Conversely...
  - balance: The deceleration and bounce should feel less sudden and stiff, meaning
      the controls are 25% more slippery again.
  - balance: Added a cooldown to spam-casting fishing rods.
  - imageadd: Resprited line reels a little.
