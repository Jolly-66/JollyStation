  - balance: Nightmare's Light Eater takes less time in jaunt to gain a critical strike,
      being reduced to 7 seconds from 15 seconds.
  - rscadd: AI's acceleration now smoothly decays, instead of just falling back down
      to 0 after 0.5 seconds
  - bugfix: AI's standard movement (non accelerated) is smooth now, instead of constantly
      jumping around
  - bugfix: AIs will now follow their targets more closely, shouldn't have any issues
      with them lagging behind anymore
  - admin: admins/maintainers can now make the profiler focus on specific subsystems
      by setting the subsystem var profile_focused to TRUE
  - bugfix: Blob Zombies now render their blob heads correctly again.
  - rscadd: Added three new 'special' bedsheets. One of them is quite rare and made
      from gondola hide.
  - bugfix: Tank spider corpses should no longer be conditionally invisible
  - refactor: Fucks with how movement keys are handled. Please report any bugs

  - bugfix: Fixed the lizardperson spine preference dropdown not showing up in the
      character menu.
  - rscadd: In an attempt to stop the greytide, NanoTrasen has increased security's
      baton energy output. This has, through testing, done nothing but make the device
      spark more than it used to.
  - rscadd: Painkillers (i.e morphine, miner's salve) now actually induce analgesic
      effects, preventing various pain-related effects, such as screaming due to pain,

  - refactor: Simplified code related to reagents adding traits.
  Timberpoes, Jolly:
